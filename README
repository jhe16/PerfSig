1. System log anomaly pattern detection and causal analysis

The codes and data are in /logs folder.

1) Each bug's data is stored in folder "bugID" like mapreduce5066 folder. "bugid".out is the funtion call trace. "bugid"-mix.log contains both buggy run and normal log. "bugid"-normal.log only contains normal run log. The generated intermediary data including function time series and log sequence time series are stored in functimevector-"bugid".pickle and logseq-"bugid".pickle.

2) Replace log data directory in logprocessing.py. Run the logprocessing.py to perform log anomaly pattern detection (including semantics-based grouping and frequent sequence mining). Check the main function and uncomment certain lines to see the results of alternative approaches.


3) Go into each bug directory, run dappertrace.py to get the function time series. The results are stored in functimevector-"bugid".pickle.


4) Go into each bug directory, run getLogSequence.py to get the log sequence time series. The results are stored in logseq-"bugid".pickle.


5) Go into each bug directory, run mi.py to perform causal analysis.


2. System metric anomaly detection and causal analysis

The codes and data are in /metrics folder.

1) The raw metric data are stored in "bugid"-workload.txt. The function call trace is stored in "bugid".out.

1) Go into each bug directory, run drawseries.py to generate system metric time series. The results are stored in "bugid"-cpu.csv.

2) Go into each bug directory, run dappertrace.py to get the function time series. The results are stored in functimevector-"bugid".pickle.

5) Go into each bug directory, run mi.py to perform causal analysis.
